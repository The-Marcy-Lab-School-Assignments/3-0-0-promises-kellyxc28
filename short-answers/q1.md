# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise');
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

Even though `Outside promise` is inside `.then()`, `Outside promise` still prints out first because it is a synchronous action. Synchronous actions are always executed before asynchronous ones because asynchronous actions wait on other actions. This is even if (for example) `setTimedOut` is set to a value of 0.
