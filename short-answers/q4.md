# Question

with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer

The arguments that we pass in are like instructions/actions as to what to do if a promise state is fulfilled (`resolve`) or not (`reject`). For example, if a promise is fulfilled, use `resolve`to print out "It was a success!". Otherwise, if a promise is rejected, use `reject` to flag an error and print out "Error: missing something!".
