# Question

What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer

`.then` is used when a promise is fulfilled while `.catch`is used to handle unfulfilled/rejected promises or errors. They are similar in the sense that they are waiting to see if a promise is fulfilled and they have their own set of "instructions"/actions for either scenario. In other words, they are like event listeners.
