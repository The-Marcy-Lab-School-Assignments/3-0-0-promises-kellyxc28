# Question

With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling _and_ returning them

# Answer

Choice A, because calling `resolve()` or `reject()` would produce a value (promise value) depending on whether the promise is fulfilled (promise state). Returning a value (choice B) is not necessary/mandatory.
